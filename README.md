# OCI Hadoop Job Automation

Automate the submission and management of Hadoop jobs on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) clusters using serverless functions. This project showcases the power of OCI Functions in streamlining Hadoop job operations, allowing you to focus on your data processing tasks rather than manual cluster management.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Job Submission:** Submit Hadoop jobs to your OCI-hosted Hadoop cluster effortlessly. Define job parameters, input, and output paths using a simple JSON request.

- **Resource Efficiency:** Automate the execution of Hadoop jobs on the cluster, optimizing resource utilization without manual intervention.

- **Status Updates:** Get real-time job status updates directly from the function. Monitor the progress of your jobs through convenient queries.

- **Flexibility:** Customize job parameters and configurations to match the needs of your specific Hadoop tasks.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the OCI Hadoop Job Automation function:

1. **OCI Configuration:** Place your OCI configuration file (`config`) in the `.oci/` directory.

2. **Function Setup:** Inside the `function/` directory, find `submit_hadoop_job.py`, which handles job submission and management. Configure any necessary parameters.

3. **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required Python dependencies listed in `function/requirements.txt`.

4. **Deployment:** Deploy the function on OCI using the appropriate tools or scripts for your environment.

## Usage

1. Submit a Hadoop job by sending a JSON request to the function with the required parameters:

```json
{
    "jar_path": "/path/to/your/hadoop/job.jar",
    "job_class": "com.example.hadoop.JobClass",
    "input_path": "/path/to/input",
    "output_path": "/path/to/output"
}
```

2. Monitor job status by querying the function for updates.
